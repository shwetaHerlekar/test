		"ARIZONA": "\nMain provisions of law\nGeneral: Arizona's Employment Protection Act prohibits adverse employment decisions based on, for example, employees exercising their civil rights. The majority of Arizona case law regarding off-duty conduct concerns cases arising from appeals from the denial of unemployment benefits. For example, Golden Eagle Distrib. v. Dep't. of Econ. Sec., 180 Ariz. 565, 885 P.2d 1130 (App. 1994), held that a private employee's termination for testing positive for cocaine was sufficiently \"connected to work.\" The other major line of cases addressing off-duty conduct relates to public servants. In those cases, courts typically hold that off-duty conduct can be a reason for dismissal. Ex.: Hamilton v. City of Mesa, 185 Ariz. 420, 916 P. 2d 1136 (App. 1995), held that termination based on off-duty conduct was valid for a police officer whose name appeared in a graphic diary describing off-duty sexual conduct with his subordinate's wife because the conduct clearly had the effect of bringing discredit or embarrassment to the city. The Arizona Medical Marijuana Act, adopted by voter initiative in November 2010, prohibits employment discrimination based on a person's status as a medical marijuana cardholder and based on a qualified patient's positive drug test for marijuana components or metabolites, unless the patient used, possessed, or was impaired by marijuana on the premises of the place of employment or during the hours of employment. An employer is exempt from the antidiscrimination provision if the failure to discriminate would cause the employer to lose a monetary or licensing related benefit under federal law or regulation. Registered cardholders include qualified patients, their designated caregivers, and agents of non-profit medical marijuana dispensaries and cultivation centers.\n\nCitation: General: A.R.S.   23-1501; Arizona Medical Marijuana Act: 36-2813(B), 36-2814. \n\nCovered employers\nAll employers. \n\n",

Any employee's conduct, including off-duty behavior, which directly conflicts or jeopardizes an employee's capacity to effectively perform his or her job can serve as sufficient grounds for dismissal. While every \"private shortcoming\" does not merit dismissal, conduct which harms the \"legitimate interests of the government\" can result in adverse employment action. Conduct unbecoming of a teacher sufficient to terminate an employment contract, besides competency, should have some nexus to the teacher's occupation. Generally, the Kentucky Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from making employment decisions based on an employee's status as a smoker, so long as the person complied with any workplace policy concerning smoking. Employers are permitted to have smoke-free facilities or to limit smoking to designated areas, but they may not restrict an employee's freedom to smoke outside the course of employment. However, it is not unlawful under Kentucky law for employers to have different contribution rates for smokers and nonsmokers in relation to an employer-sponsored health plan or to be offered incentives or benefits for participation in smoking cessation programs.

		"FEDERAL": "\nEmployees view certain aspects of their lives as off-limits to employers. Many of them believe that as long as they work hard, their employer shouldn t care what they do when they leave work. Employers argue that they have legitimate concerns about conduct affecting their reputation, the employee s job performance, or other employees. Thus, employers believe that certain off-duty behavior   particularly off-duty behavior that runs afoul of the law   should be considered job-related and subject to some employer control.Laws concerning protection of employee off-duty activities vary tremendously from state to state. Some states expressly prohibit employers from allowing an employee s lawful offduty conduct to have any effect on the terms and conditions of her employment. Even where such actions aren t prohibited, there are pitfalls for employers who take them. For example, an employee who is discharged for off-duty activity will likely be entitled to unemployment insurance. If the employer is unable to show how that off-duty conduct related to its legitimate business needs or violated a duty owed to the employer, the discharge is more likely to be ruled  no fault of the employee  for the purposes of unemployment compensation.In addition, remember that employees   concerted activity  in pursuit of collective bargaining is protected by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). From this, some off-duty conduct (for example, political activity) may overlap with discussions of economics, working conditions, and wages.\n\n",

Iowa courts also consider the federal regulations established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) because the EEOC is responsible for enforcing the ADA and cases interpreting the Rehabilitation Act because the Act's definition of \"disability\" is similar to the term's meaning in the ADA.

Persons with current or past controlled substances abuse or alcohol abuse and persons excluded from coverage by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 are excluded from coverage under the KCRA. KRS    344.010. These definitions are substantially the same as the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, although the KCRA has not been amended to take on the more expansive definition that the ADA did in 2008. Therefore, the Kentucky definition is not as broad as the Federal definition in application. Also, the KCRA definitions of reasonable accommodation and undue hardship mirror the federal law.\n\n\nAge\nThe Kentucky Civil Rights Act (KRS ch. 344) defines    age    as any individual age 40 and older, which is identical to the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (29 U.S.C.    631).

		"RHODE ISLAND": "\nDisability\nThe Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA) prohibits discrimination based on disability and states that it's an unlawful practice to \"refuse to reasonably accommodate an employee's or prospective employee's disability unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would pose a hardship on the employer's program.\" The definition of disability is essentially the same as that of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Because of action by the state Legislature, the issue of whether a person is disabled under state law is \"determined without regard to the availability or use of mitigating measures such as reasonable accommodations, prosthetic devices, medications or auxiliary aids.\" Also, the Rhode Island Civil Rights of People With Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination against the disabled. Like FEPA, it requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations. The primary difference between the Civil Rights of People With Disabilities Act and FEPA is that the civil rights act allows individuals to bypass the Commission for Human Rights and immediately file suit in state court (Fair Employment Practices Act: R.I.Gen.Laws    28-5-1 \n\net seq.

Unlike FEPA, there is no requirement that individuals file an administrative complaint with the Commission for Human Rights prior to filing suit in state court. The Wage Discrimination Based on Sex law, (R.I.Gen.Laws    28-6-17 et seq.) makes it unlawful for employers to discriminate in the payment of wages between the sexes. Rhode Island also requires employers with more than 50 employees to promote a workplace free from sexual harassment (R.I.Gen.Laws   28-51-2). The Rhode Island Homeless Bill of Rights prohibits discrimination based on a person's homeless status.

		"CALIFORNIA": "\nDisability\nThe Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Cal. Gov   t.

The FEHA also prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or medical conditions related to the above. (Cal. Gov   t Code    12926(q)(1).) The FEHA only requires that the physical or mental disability    limits    (rather than    substantially limits,    as required by the federal ADA) a major life activity, i.e., it makes the achievement of a major life activity difficult. The FEHA also covers employees who are regarded or treated as having or having had a physical or mental condition that has no presently disabling effect, but may become a disability in the future. The unlawful use of controlled substances or other drugs isn   t protected by FEHA (Cal. Gov   t. Code    12926(i) and (k)).    Medical condition    includes any (1) health impairment related to or associated with a diagnosis of cancer or a record or history of cancer and (2) genetic characteristics. (Cal. Gov   t Code 12926(h)).\n\n\nAge\nCal. Gov   t. Code    12940-12941 prohibits discrimination or harassment on the basis of age against anyone 40 or over. FEHA doesn   t prohibit employers from providing health benefits or health care reimbursement plans to retired persons that are altered, reduced, or eliminated when the retiree becomes eligible for Medicare benefits with respect to any retiree health benefit plans or contractual provisions or practices concerning retiree health benefits and health care reimbursement plans in effect on or after January 1, 2011.\n\n\nMarital status\nCal. Gov   t. Code    12940 prohibits employment discrimination based on marital status. The Fair Employment and Housing Commission has extended discrimination on the basis of marital status to mean not only discrimination based on being married or single but also to the denial of a benefit because of the employment or lack of employment of the individual   s spouse (Cal. Admin. Code Title 2    7292.2).\n\n\nLGBT status\nCal. Gov   t Code 12940, 12926 (m), (p), (q) expressly prohibits discrimination against any person because of his/her sexual orientation, which means    heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality,    gender identity, or gender expression. Gender expression means a person   s gender-related appearance and behavior whether or not stereotypically associated with the person   s assigned sex at birth.\n\n\nOther\nIt is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against employees, applicants, unpaid interns, and volunteers based on race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status. An employer is also prohibited from harassing an employee, applicant, independent contractor, unpaid intern, or volunteer based on any of the above characteristics. The FEHA anti-discrimination and anti-harassment protections extend to unpaid interns and volunteers. Religious dress practice or a religious grooming practice as a belief or observance is covered by FEHA   s   protections against religious discrimination, and an accommodation of an individual   s religious dress practice or religious grooming practice that would require that person to be segregated from the public or other employees is not a reasonable accommodation. (Cal. Gov   t Code 12926 and 12940.) Employers may not retaliate against anyone for opposing discriminatory or harassing practices, filing a complaint, or testifying in any proceeding. (Cal. Gov   t Code 12940.) California has a variety of laws protecting illegal immigrants. Also, discrimination based on Native American tribal affiliation violates the law. The Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code    51 et seq.) prohibits business establishments from discriminating based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, marital status, and sexual orientation. State law prohibits employers from using consumer credit reports to make employment decisions about employees or job applicants (Cal. Labor Code    1024.5). Under Cal. Labor Code    1024.6, an employer may not discriminate against an employee because the employee updates his personal information based on a lawful change of name, social security number, or federal employment authorization document. Under the California Equal Pay Act, employers are prohibited from paying employees less than employees of the opposite sex for substantially similar work unless the employer demonstrates the wage differential is based on (1) a seniority system, (2) a merit system, (3) a system that measures earnings by quantity or quality of production, or (4) a bona fide factor other than sex.

		"ILLINOIS": "\nDisability\nHandicap discrimination is covered under the Illinois Human Rights Act (IHRA) with a couple of differences from the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Handicap is defined as a determinable physical or mental characteristic of a person that may result from disease, injury, functional disorder, or congenital condition and is unrelated to a person   s ability to perform the duties of a particular job with reasonable accommodation. Some case law exists that denies protection to individuals claiming handicap discrimination under the IHRA who would otherwise be covered under the ADA because the person   s condition wasn   t unrelated to the ability to perform the job.\n\nIn addition, unlike the ADA, an employer   s duty of reasonable accommodation under the state law doesn   t extend to offering a handicapped employee a different job than the one the employee was hired to do (775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq.). Employers must also not discriminate in the payment of wages on the basis of mental or physical handicap except as allowed under 820 ILCS 105/5.\n\n\nAge\nProtected category in Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq.). Protects all over age 40.\n\n\nMarital status\nProtected category in Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq.).\n\n\nLGBT status\nProtected category in Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq.). Also covered in some city and county ordinances.\n\n\nOther\nCitizenship status, ancestry, pregnancy, being protected by an order of protection, arrest record, military status (active duty and veteran status), and unfavorable military discharge (with some exceptions) are protected under the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq.). In addition, the Illinois Human Rights Act prohibits employers from imposing    English only    rules for communications that are unrelated to the employee   s duties. The Illinois Department of Human Rights may issue a notice of default against an employer who fails to file a verified response to a charge within 60 days of receipt of notice of the charge, unless the employer can show    good cause,    defined narrowly to include, for example, death or sudden, serious illness of the employer   s representative (56 ILAC 2520.405).\n\nIt is a civil rights violation for an employer participating in the E-Verify Program to act with respect to recruitment, hiring, promotion, discharge, discipline, tenure, or terms, privileges, or conditions of employment without following the procedures under the E-Verify Program (775 ILCS 5/2-102(G)(2)). In addition to not discriminating on the basis of pregnancy, employers also have a duty to reasonably accommodate a pregnant employee or applicant   s known medical or common conditions of pregnancy or childbirth. However, the employer cannot require the pregnant employee/applicant to take a reasonable accommodation when they did not request one. The employer also cannot require a pregnant employee to take leave if another reasonable accommodation can be provided. A pregnant employee taking leave as part of reasonable accommodation must be reinstated to her original job or an equivalent position unless it would impose an undue hardship on the employer (775 ILCS 5/2-102(J)). Also, violations of the Military Leave Absence Act and the Public Employee Armed Services Rights Act are civil rights violations under the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-102; 5 ILCS 325/1.01 and 5 ILCS 330/5.1). The definition of    employee    includes unpaid interns meeting certain coverage requirements for the purposes of    sexual harassment.    775 ILCS 5/2-101(A)(1); 775 ILCS 5/2-102(D). The Illinois Equal Pay Act of 2003 was amended to apply to all employers rather than only those with more than 3 employees. The amendment also increased the maximum civil penalty for all violations of the Act or a rule from $2,500 to $5,000. The Illinois Veterans Preference Act, 330 ILCS 55, allows private employers to voluntarily establish preference in employment for certain veterans. The law applies to veterans of the five service branches, their reserve components, and the Illinois National Guard.\n\n\n",
		"FEDERAL": "\nDiscrimination is any workplace action such as hiring, firing, demoting, or promoting based on a prejudice of some kind that results in the unlawful treatment of protected classes. With some exceptions, such as affirmative action, discrimination is strictly prohibited by myriad federal laws.Perhaps the most well-known federal antidiscrimination law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. Title VII applies to all private employers, state and local governments, and education institutions that employ 15 or more individuals.However, Title VII is but one discrimination law. The Equal Pay Act (EPA) prohibits sex-based wage discrimination between men and women who perform under similar working conditions. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits discrimination against people age 40 and older. The ADEA covers private employers with 20 or more employees, state and local governments (including school districts), employment agencies, and labor organizations. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination against a qualified person with a disability because of the disability, association with someone with a disability, or because the employer sees an employee as disabled, even if he actually isn t. The ADA applies to the same list of employers as Title VII.Many states also have laws prohibiting discrimination that may include additional protected categories. In this chapter, laws that go beyond the Title VII requirements are discussed. \n\n",
		"MONTANA": "\nDisability\nThe Montana Human Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating because of physical or mental disability. Specifically,    it is unlawful to discriminate, in hiring or employment, against a person because of the person   s physical disability.    It should be noted that    there is no discrimination when the nature or extent of the disability reasonably precludes the performance of the particular employment or when the particular employment may subject the person with a disability or that person   s fellow employees to physical harm    (Mont.

		"MASSACHUSETTS": "\nDisability\nDiscrimination and harassment because of handicap is prohibited. There are several differences between state and federal disability discrimination laws. State law includes the provision that reasonable accommodation requires the employee to be capable of performing the essential functions of the position involved. Russell v. Cooley Dickinson Hospital, Inc., 437 Mass. 443, 453-54, 772 N.E.2d 1054, 1063 (2002). Additionally, reasonable accommodation does not require an employer to allow a full-time employee to maintain his/her position if the employee must work a significantly reduced number of hours on a long-term basis, thereby not being able to complete the essential functions of his/her job. Tompson v. Dep   t of Mental Health, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 924 N.E.2d 747 (2010).

The WLAD supports a disability-based \"hostile work environment\" cause of action (Robel v. Round-Up Corp., 148 Wn.2d 35 (2002)). The state law also has been interpreted as imposing strict accommodation requirements on employers. Employers must initiate attempts to accommodate the disability if it starts to interfere with an employee's job performance. If the employer fails to explore alternative means of accommodation and it's later sued for disability bias, it will have the burden of showing that each of the employee's suggestions for accommodation would have been unreasonable. The state law differs from the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in its definition of \"disability\" (see RCW 49.60.040(7)).

Labor Code    21.105, 21.002, 21.128, and 21.260).\n\nAge\nCompulsory retirement isn't prohibited for employees who are at least 65; employed in bona fide executive or high policy-making positions for two years preceding retirement; and entitled to immediate, nonforfeitable annual retirement benefits from a pension, profit-sharing, savings, or deferred compensation plan or a combination of plans that equals, in the aggregate, at least $27,000 (Tex. Labor Code   21.103). Generally, discrimination because of age applies only to individuals 40 and older (Tex. Labor Code   21.101). Employers don't commit an unlawful employment practice by imposing a minimum or maximum age requirement for peace officers or firefighters (Tex. Labor Code   21.104).\n\nMarital status\nNo law.\n\nLGBT status\nThere is no state law regarding discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation, but major cities and some counties, including Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Houston, Austin, El Paso, Brownsville, Waco, Dallas County, and Walker County have ordinances prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, while the cities of Grande Prairie and Lubbock have ordinances prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation only.\n\nOther\nEffective September 1, 2015, HB1151 prohibits the sexual harassment of unpaid interns. The law creates an offense if the employer's agents or supervisors know or should have knowledge of conduct constituting sexual harassment was occurring with respect to an unpaid intern and fail to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. Interns attempting to bring a claim under the law will still have to file a complaint with the Texas Workforce Commission Civil Rights Division and otherwise exhaust all administrative remedies.\n\n"

The NLRB defines  protected, concerted activity  broadly. The NLRB s interpretation of the term encompasses a number of situations in which many employers might mistakenly think they are free to discipline an employee however it sees fit.Under the NLRA, it s unlawful to discharge or otherwise discriminate against employees because of their union activities. The NLRA also protects employees from discharge or retaliation because of participation in protected concerted activity unrelated to union activity.In essence, the law protects an employee s right to act in concert with one or more other employees in furtherance of a common concern regarding any term or condition of employment.\n\n",

		"CALIFORNIA": "\nMajor provisions of law\nEmployers may not employ a nonexempt employee for a period of more than five hours per day without providing the employee with a meal period, which may be unpaid, of at least 30 minutes, with the exception that if the total work period per day of the employee is no more than six hours, the meal period may be waived by mutual consent of both the employer and employee. Employers may not employ an employee for a work period of more than 10 hours per day without providing the employee with a second meal period, which may be unpaid, of not less than 30 minutes. But if the total hours worked are no more than 12, the second meal period may be waived by mutual consent but only if the first meal period wasn't waived. (However, employees in the health care industry who work shifts in excess of eight (8) total hours in a workday may voluntarily waive their right to one of their two meal periods. In order to be valid, any such waiver must be documented in a written agreement that is voluntarily signed by both the employee and the employer. The employee may revoke the waiver at any time by providing the employer at least one (1) day's written notice. The employee shall be fully compensated for all working time, including any on-the-job meal period, while such a waiver is in effect. 8 C.C.R. 11040; 2015 SB 327.) According to the California Supreme Court's decision in Brinker Rest. Corp. v. Superior Court, \"an employer must relieve the employee of all duty for the designated period, but need not ensure that the employee does no work.\" An employer's duty with respect to meal breaks is \"an obligation to provide a meal period to its employees. The employer satisfies this obligation if it relieves its employees of all duty, relinquishes control over their activities and permits them a reasonable opportunity to take an uninterrupted 30-minute break, and does not impede or discourage them from doing so.\" When an employee works for five hours, an employer is put to a choice: it must (1) afford an off-duty meal period; (2) consent to a mutually agreed-upon waiver if one hour or less will end the shift (i.e., if the employee works a shift that lasts no more than six hours); or (3) obtain a written agreement to a paid on-duty meal period provided (a) the nature of the work prevents an employee from being relieved of all duty; (b) the employer and employee previously entered into a signed agreement authoring on-duty meal periods; and (c) the signed agreement expressly states the employee may, in writing, revoke the agreement at any time. If a meal period is not provided, the employer is liable for one hour of pay for each day a meal period is missed. Also, every employer covered by a California wage order must authorize and permit nonexempt employees to take rest periods, which insofar as practicable must be in the middle of each work period. The rest period must be based on the total hours worked daily at the rate of 10 minutes rest time per four hours or major fraction thereof. In Brinker Rest. Corp. v. Superior Court, the California Supreme Court interpreted the phrase a \"major fraction thereof\" as applied to a four-hour period to mean any amount of time in excess of two hours   i.e., any fraction greater than half. However, a rest period need not be authorized for employees whose total daily work time is less than three and one-half (3 ) hours. Accordingly, employees are entitled to one 10-minute rest break for shifts from three and one-half to six hours in length, two 10-minute rest breaks for shifts of more than six hours up to 10 hours, three 10-minute rest breaks for shifts of more than 10 hours up to 14 hours, and so on. If a rest period is not provided, the employer is liable for one hour of pay for each day a rest period is missed. There are separate meal and rest break requirements for persons in specialized industries such as the motion picture industry. SB 435, effective 1/1/14, provides that employees are entitled to a recovery period if working outdoors in temperatures exceeding 85 degrees. Employees shall be given a cool-down rest for no less than 5 minutes when they feel the need to do so to protect them from overheating. SB 1360 (signed 6/28/14) clarified that similar to rest breaks, recovery periods are counted as hours worked. Employees paid on a piece-rate basis must be compensated for rest and recovery periods at a regular hourly rate that is no less than the higher of: (i) the applicable minimum wage, or (ii) an average hourly rate determined by dividing the total compensation for the workweek, exclusive of compensation for rest and recovery periods and any premium compensation for overtime, by the total hours worked during the workweek, exclusive of rest and recovery periods. Total hours of compensable rest and recovery period must be included in the employee's itemized wage statement.\n\nCitation: Cal. Lab.

		"FEDERAL": "\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) doesn t require meal or rest breaks. However, federal law does specify that rest breaks of fewer than 20 minutes must be included in work time, and for a break to be unpaid, the employee must be relieved of all work duties.Employers may not place any restrictions on a nonexempt employee s activities while on a break. If employees are restricted in what they can do or where they can be, an employer may have an obligation to pay them for the break. This could include overtime pay if adding in the break time increases the employee s hours worked to more than 40 hours in a given week.Confusion over whether a meal break is compensable usually arises when employees aren t permitted to leave during meal breaks or when it isn t practical for them to leave and return to work within the time allotted. If they are required to remain on the premises during breaks, they must be completely relieved of performing any work duties.That requirement isn t met if workers are required to perform any duties, whether active or inactive, while eating. For example, an office employee who is required to eat at his desk or a factory worker who is required to be at his machine is working while eating. Similarly, employees who face frequent interruptions, are required to attend meetings, or remain on call to return to work at a moment s notice aren t completely relieved of their duties and must be paid for their meal periods.A number of states do require employers to allow workers to take periodic breaks for meals or to rest; the number and timing of these breaks generally depends on the number of hours worked.\n\n",

During the meal break the employee must be relieved of all job duties and free to leave the premises. Another meal break would have to be provided if the employee were required to work another six hours after resuming work. Meal breaks can be unpaid. The meal break requirement is not applicable to iron works, glass works, paper mills, letterpress establishments, print works, bleaching works, or dyeing works. Employers may apply for waivers for specific jobs if continuous operation is a requirement of the position, but applications must be approved through the attorney general's office. Currently, Massachusetts does not require rest or coffee breaks, though as a practical matter, many employers do provide a 10- to 15-minute break. Employers should note that under U.S. Department of Labor regulations, breaks shorter than 20 minutes must be counted as \"hours worked\" and must be paid. For domestic workers, effective April 15, 2015, working time must include sleep, rest, and meal breaks unless the worker is clearly off duty and able to use the time for purely personal activity, either on or off the premises. When a domestic worker works 24 consecutive hours or more, all meal times, rest periods, and sleeping periods will be considered working hours, unless the employer and the employee make a prior, written agreement. When a domestic worker is required to be on duty for a period of 24 consecutive hours or more, the employer and the domestic worker may agree to exclude a regularly scheduled sleeping period of not more than 8 hours per 24-hour shift from compensable working time. \n\nCitation: Mass.

If the veteran is found to possess the qualifications required for the position applied for, whether educational or by way of prior experience, and is physically and mentally able to perform the duties of the position applied for, the officer, board, or person shall employ the veteran. A disabled veteran is entitled to a preference superior to that given other veterans under this section, which preference must be accorded in the manner provided in this section. If the group of eligible individuals includes veterans or disabled veterans, the disabled veteran is first entitled to the position absent justifiable cause. If there are two or more disabled veterans, then the employing authority shall fill the position from the group of eligible individuals to be considered. Further inquiry into the qualifications of each eligible individual from within that group may be done. A disabled veteran is first entitled to the position, absent justifiable cause. If the group of eligible individuals includes veterans but no disabled veterans, the employing authority shall fill the position from the group of eligible individuals to be considered.

Unremarried spouses of veterans who died in service or from a service-connected cause are entitled to the preference given the veteran. Spouses of disabled veterans are entitled to the disabled veteran preference if the veteran is unable to exercise the right to the preference because of the disability. If a veteran or a qualified veteran's spouse is not hired for a position applied for, the veteran or spouse must be notified by the employer of the reasons for non-selection. The notice must also inform the veteran or spouse of the right to an appeal hearing, with instructions for the form and manner of requesting the hearing.Effective August 1, 2013, a new section allowing private employers to provide a preference to a veteran or a veteran's spouse for employment goes into effect.

Under the law, any two persons who are otherwise eligible to marry under state law may be legally married, regardless of gender. Any terms used in state laws, regulations, or rules that relate to marriage will apply equally to a same-sex marriage. A legal union other than a marriage that is entered into in another jurisdiction and provides substantially the same rights, benefits, and responsibilities as a marriage is afforded the same rights, benefits, and responsibilities as a valid marriage in Rhode Island. Employers in Rhode Island with fully insured health plans that are subject to state laws must offer coverage to employees' same-sex spouses on the same terms as it is offered to employees' opposite-sex spouses. Civil unions: Effective August 1, 2013, civil union licenses are not available in Rhode Island. A couple in an existing same-sex civil union may obtain a marriage license and have the civil union legally designated as a marriage. The effective date of the marriage is the date the marriage certificate is recorded in the town clerk's office.Domestic partners: Domestic partners of state employees are included within the definition of \"family members\" for purposes of the Rhode Island Parental and Family Medical Leave Act and within the definition of \"dependent\" for COBRA purposes. Dependents of state-government employees are defined to include domestic partners and aren't restricted to a homosexual partner. As a result, domestic partners are entitled to receive health insurance coverage from the state. They are required, however, to provide an affidavit attesting to the relationship. Private employers are not required to offer insurance to an unmarried partner, but they may be required to offer insurance to an employee's civil union partner.

Employers must offer the same benefits to same-sex spouses and registered domestic partners as are offered to opposite-sex spouses. California law prohibits state agencies from entering into any contract for the acquisition of goods or services in the amount of $100,000 or more with a contractor who, in the provision of benefits, discriminates between employees with spouses and employees with domestic partners, or discriminates between employees with spouses or domestic partners of a different sex and employees with spouses or domestic partners of the same sex, or discriminates between same-sex and different-sex domestic partners of employees or between same-sex and different-sex spouses of employees.Senate Bill 703, effective 1/1/16, prohibits a state agency from entering into contracts for the acquisition of goods or services of $100,000 or more with a contractor that discriminates in the provision of benefits on the basis of an employee's or dependent's actual or perceived gender identity, including, but not limited to, the employee's or dependent's identification as transgender. . \n\nCitation: Cal.

Los Angeles has a law that requires municipal contractors that offer health insurance to workers and their spouses to also extend the benefits to gay, lesbian, and heterosexual domestic partners. Under the rule, gay and heterosexual domestic partners can seek benefits from employers that already offer health benefits and have city contracts worth at least $5,000.

		"HAWAII": "\nMajor provisions of law\nHawaii reciprocal beneficiary law requires that insurers who provide \"family coverage\" health insurance policies to employers must provide reciprocal beneficiary family coverage to employees who have registered with the state as reciprocal beneficiaries to the same extent that coverage is available to individuals who aren't reciprocal beneficiaries. Note: Reciprocal beneficiaries are defined as any two adults, neither of whom is married or a partner in a civil union and who are legally prohibited from marrying each other. The attorney general's office has issued an opinion letter, however, stating that employers who offer family coverage but don't wish to offer reciprocal beneficiary family coverage have the option of self-funding or using mutual benefit societies or health maintenance organizations, which aren't subject to the same requirements as insurers. Also, with respect to state-government employees, state law provides that widows, widowers, and reciprocal beneficiaries of deceased state employees who were entitled to a pension at the time of death are entitled to receive the same pension and benefits as the deceased employee so long as the widow or widower doesn't remarry or the reciprocal beneficiary doesn't enter into a new reciprocal beneficiary relationship. Effective January 1, 2012, partners in civil unions are entitled to the same rights, benefits, protections, and responsibilities of individuals in a traditional marriage. Accordingly, employers in Hawaii must extend the same benefits to parties in a civil union as they do to spouses in a marriage. These benefits may include health insurance, other types of insurance, leave entitlements, and merchandise discounts. Effective December 2, 2013, state law legally recognizes same-sex marriage. Same-sex spouses are entitled to the same rights, benefits, protections, and responsibilities as opposite-sex spouses.

Marriages between same-sex couples \"shall have all the same benefits, protections, and responsibilities under law, whether they derive from statute, administrative or court rule, policy, common law, or any other source of civil or criminal law\" as marriages between different-sex couples. As a result, certain benefits that are regulated by IL state law will likely need to be extended to same-sex married couples. For example, if an employer maintains an insured health plan (versus a self-insured plan) that provides for coverage of heterosexual spouses, the plan will be required to offer the same for same-sex spouses.Civil unions: Illinois also recognizes \"civil unions\" between same-sex and opposite-sex couples. This includes \"civil unions\" and substantially similar legal relationships (other than common law marriages) which are legally entered into in another state. Couples in civil unions are \"entitled to the same legal obligations, responsibilities, protections, and benefits as are afforded or recognized by the law of Illinois to spouses.\" As a result, certain benefits regulated by state law may need to be extended to civil unions.Same-sex domestic partners: By Administrative Order, the governor has extended spousal health benefits to all same-sex domestic partners of all state employees in agencies under his jurisdiction. \n\nCitation: Same-sex marriages: 750 ILCS 5/201; Civil unions: 750 ILCS 75/1 \n\net seq.\n\nCovered employers\nSame-sex marriages: All employees.

		"FEDERAL": "\nFor decades, the question of benefits for same-sex partners was a serious administrative question for employers. From 1996 up to the date of a historic ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2013, the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) limited to opposite-sex married couples the spousal rights and responsibilities available under federal laws, including laws such as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). After that ruling, married same-sex couples in states where such marriages were legal were entitled to be recognized as spouses for purposes of federal law and are eligible for equal benefits under numerous federal programs. But that still left the question of what employers in states where same-sex marriage wasn   t legal should do for employees in same-sex marriages performed in states where it was legal.\n\nOn June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4   in Obergefell v. Hodges that the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires states to license same-sex marriages and to recognize a same-sex marriage that is legally entered into in another jurisdiction. As a result of the ruling, laws in every state providing for spousal benefits must extend to same-sex spouses on equal footing with the benefits required for opposite-sex spouses.\n\nEmployers should review their policies to ensure that any policy providing spousal benefits will apply equally to an employee with a same-sex spouse.   This is particularly important where state law provides eligible employees with leave to care for a spouse.   The change in law also affects withholding for state and local income taxes for employees with a same-sex spouse, retirement benefits, and healthcare continuation.   Employers should contact their insurance carriers, benefits providers, and payroll company to determine the effect of the new law and for assistance in providing up-to-date information to employees.\n\nSeveral states have laws that provide legal recognition of personal relationships in the form of domestic partnerships or civil unions.   Some states including Hawaii, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C., recognize domestic partnerships from other jurisdictions.\n\n\n",

Article III Judge Brian Morris, United States District Court for the District of Montana held that these statutes, and all laws that ban same-sex marriage, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Further, the Montana Supreme Court has held that \"any organization that adopts an administrative procedure in order to provide employment benefits to opposite-sex partners who may not be in a legal marital relationship, must do the same for same-sex couples.

		"IOWA": "\nMain provisions of law\nContracts restraining trade or commerce are prohibited. However, noncompetes are enforceable if they are no broader than what is reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer s business interests and they don t impose undue hardship on the employee. Also, enforceable noncompetes may not be prejudicial to the public interest. In assessing reasonableness, Iowa courts generally examine both time and area restrictions. Agreements prohibiting employees from entering a competing business after discharge are unreasonable if they re unlimited as to time or area. Iowa courts have generally found that a five-year time period is at the outer limits of what is enforceable. A noncompete that prohibited competition within a 100-mile radius of an employer s Iowa offices was held to be unreasonable when the employer had a relatively large number of offices in the state, resulting in a prohibition of competition in virtually the whole state.\n* Citation: Iowa Code 553.4; Lamp v.

In particular, courts often look at the following questions: (1) does the noncompete protect a legitimate business interest of the employer (the two primary interests are customer contacts and trade secrets); (2) does it create an undue burden on the employee; (3) does it injure the public welfare; and (4) are the restrictions on time and scope reasonable.\nCitation: Weber v.

Any noncompetition covenant that violates this law is void. This one-year restriction does not apply to noncompetition covenants in reasonable severance agreements containing a noncompetition restrictive covenant agreed to in good faith at or after the time of the termination of the employment relationship or to noncompetition covenants related to or arising out of the sale of a business as long as the individual subject to the covenant receives value related to the sale of the business.

Use of form language from prior court rulings does not ensure enforcement since each case must be evaluated on its own merits. Noncompetes will be upheld only when an employee is prohibited from competing with a former employer directly or through a competitor.

Several factors are to be considered in determining reasonableness: time and geographic limits, whether an employee represents the sole contact with a customer, whether an employee possesses confidential information or trade secrets, whether the agreement seeks to eliminate competition that would be unfair to the employer or merely seeks to eliminate ordinary competition, whether the agreement seeks to stifle the inherent skill and experience of the employee, whether the benefit to the employer is disproportional to the detriment of the employee, whether the agreement acts as a bar to the employee s sole means of support, whether the employee s talent that the employer seeks to suppress was actually developed during the period of employment, and whether the forbidden employment is merely incidental to the main employment.\n* Citation: DeCristofaro v.

		"GEORGIA": "\nMain provisions of law\nHistorically, Georgia courts have been extremely strict when addressing noncompetes, requiring them to be reasonably limited as to scope, time, and geographic restrictions. Georgia courts refused to  blue pencil,  so if a clause violated the law, the entire provision was removed.\nO.C.G.A. 13-8-2.1 now allows courts to  blue pencil  noncompete agreements that are overbroad, rather than holding them completely unenforceable. The new law only applies to contracts executed on or after the effective date of the statute; older agreements are still governed by prior, stricter case law.\nThere has, however, been some controversy and confusion surrounding this effective date. Though O.C.G.A. 13-8-2.1 was initially passed in 2009, it could not take effect until passage of a companion amendment to the state constitution. This amendment was approved by Georgia voters on November 2, 2010, yet issues raised regarding the validity of portions of the law further complicated the determination of the effective date of the measure. The law itself claimed to take effect the day after voter passage (November 3), yet the constitutional amendment would not have taken effect until January 1, 2011, at which point some critics still felt the law was invalid.\nTo clear up this confusion, H.B. 30, signed on May 11, 2011, made the new noncompete law effective and gives assurance that the new law applies to all contracts executed after that date. It is also certain that contracts entered into before November 3, 2010, are subject to the old law. For agreements entered into between those dates, courts will have to interpret which law applies.

Noncompete agreements must be supported by adequate consideration, which can include employment or continued employment for a    substantial period    after the agreement is signed.

		"FEDERAL": "\nOne of the most common contractual provisions used in employment situations is the covenant not to compete or  restrictive covenant.  These clauses serve to dissuade employees from leaving after you have invested a lot of time and money in them and limit their ability to compete with you after they leave.Restrictive covenants can be absolutely vital in protecting your investment in a new employee and guarding your proprietary secrets. And because most people want to honor their commitments, they can be a powerful incentive for your best employees to stay. For the most part, they should be reserved only for high-level employees whose competitive knowledge or skill could damage your business if used elsewhere.Although there are some general rules of thumb for whether a court will find a contested restricted covenant enforceable or not, the degree to which these courts will back a restrictive covenant differs significantly from state to state.\n\n",

If the restriction is overbroad in any respect (such as time, duration, geographic location, scope of work, client restrictions) such that it does not protect an employer s legitimate interests but instead seeks to prevent ordinary competition, a court will rewrite the agreement so that it reflects only what is reasonably necessary to protect the employer s legitimate interests. \nFactors to consider in determining whether the terms of a noncompetition agreement are reasonable to protect an employer s legitimate business interests include:  whether the employee represents the sole contact with the customers, whether the employee is possessed with confidential information or trade secrets, whether the covenant seeks to eliminate competition that would be unfair to the employer or merely seeks to eliminate ordinary competition, whether the covenant seeks to stifle the inherent skill and experience of the employee, whether the benefit to the employer is disproportional to the detriment to the employee, whether the covenant operates as a bar to the employee s sole means of support, whether the employee s talent the employer seeks to suppress was actually developed during the period of employment, and whether the forbidden employment is merely incidental to the main employment.  Other special rules may apply. For example, continued employment is adequate consideration for a promise not to compete. Liquidated damages provisions may be used as a means of preventing unfair competition.

The lack of a specific geographic region restriction does not make the noncompete overly broad if the agreement is limited in time and scope in a manner no greater than necessary to defend the protectable business interest.\nWhether a noncompete is reasonable depends on (1) the nature of the employer   s business interest; (2) the geographic scope of the employer   s business and whether geographic limitation is feasible under the circumstances; (3) whether the restriction placed on the employee is limited to a specific group of customers or other individuals or entities associated with the employer   s interest; and (4) the nature of the employer   s business. The statue creates a presumptively reasonable post-termination restriction of 2 years.\nIf restrictions in the noncompete are found to be unreasonable and impose a greater restraint than necessary to protect the employer   s protectable business interest, the statute directs the court to reform the noncompete agreement to the extent necessary to cause the limitation to be reasonable and impose a restraint that is not greater than necessary to protect the employer   s protectable business interest. The court will then enforce the reformed noncompete agreement.\nA protectable business interest includes, for example: trade secrets; intellectual property; customer lists; goodwill; knowledge of business practices; methods; profit margins; costs; other business information that is confidential, proprietary, and increases in value from not being known by a competitor; training and education of the employer   s employees; and other valuable employer data that the employer has provided to an employee that an employer would reasonably seek to protect or safeguard from a competitor in the interest of fairness.\nThe statute does not apply to noncompete agreements that are ancillary to contractual relationships other than employment relationships. For example, the statute does not apply to noncompete agreements ancillary to the sale and purchase of a business franchise agreement. Existing common law standards apply to noncompete agreements outside of the employment context.\nWith regard to noncompete agreements outside of the employment context, courts have noted that the burden is on the party challenging the agreement to show that it is unreasonable, and agreements are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. A court has recognized that for an agreement to be enforced, three requirements must be met: (1) the employer must have a valid interest to protect, (2) the geographical restriction must not be overly broad, and (3) a reasonable time limit must be imposed.\nCitation: Duffner v.

		"TEXAS": "\nState agency\nTexas Workforce Commission, Civil Rights Division.\n\nHow cases are adjudicated\nComplaints are investigated by the Texas Workforce Commission, Civil Rights Division. An employee has 180 days from the date of the alleged discriminatory act to file a charge of discrimination with the Texas Workforce Commission (Tex. Labor Code   21.202). The commission investigates a complaint to determine if there is reasonable cause to believe the respondent engaged in an unlawful employment practice (Tex. Labor Code   21.204). If the commission makes a finding that the evidence does not support the complaint, it will issue a written determination dismissing the complaint (Tex. Labor Code   21.205). If after investigation the commission determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondent engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the commission shall issue a written determination incorporating the evidence that supports the complaint (Tex. Labor Code   21.206). If the commission makes a finding of reasonable cause, the commission shall endeavor to eliminate the alleged unlawful employment practice by conference, conciliation, and persuasion (Tex. Labor Code   21.207). The commission may bring a civil action against a respondent if the conciliation efforts prove unsuccessful (Tex. Labor Code   21.251). If the commission dismisses a complaint or fails to resolve the complaint before the 181st day after the complaint was filed, the commission will inform the complainant of the dismissal or failure to resolve the complaint in writing (Tex. Labor Code   21.208). Where a complaint is dismissed or not resolved, the complainant may request and/or the commission may automatically issue a Notice of Right to File a Civil Action (Tex. Labor Code   21.252).    The Notice advises the complainant that he or she has a right to bring a private civil action in state court within 60 days (Tex. Labor Code   21.254). However, failure of the commission to issue a Notice of Right to File a Civil Action does not affect the complainant s right under the Code to bring a civil action against the respondent (Tex. Labor Code   21.252).\n\nIndividual liability\nNone.\n\nLocal laws in major cities\nMajor cities and some counties, including Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Houston, Austin, El Paso, Brownsville, Waco, Dallas County, and Walker County have ordinances prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, while the cities of Grande Prairie and Lubbock have ordinances prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation only.\n\n"

		"FEDERAL": "\nMany of the employment laws administered by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) require notices of employee rights to be posted in the workplace. A few examples include the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Family and Medical Leave Act.Generally, federal workplace posters must be displayed or posted in a conspicuous place where they are easily visible to all employees the intended audience. Some posters, such as the FMLA, EEO, and EPPA posters, are also required to be placed where they can be seen by applicants for employment.In addition to the federal requirements, every state has provisions requiring the posting of various kinds of law-related notices in the workplace. In many states, the prescribed notices are available from state labor authorities at no charge to the employer. Most mandatory notices are intended to advise workers of their legal rights and duties in such areas as payment of wages, regulation of working hours, benefits for the unemployed and for those injured on the job, unlawful discrimination, family leave,  whistleblower  protections, plant closing regulations, and workplace safety and health. In some cases the manner of posting is prescribed, but the standard requirement is that mandatory notices be posted conspicuously and in enough places so that employees can see them as they enter and exit the workplace.\n\n",

Information shall not be required of a member of one class that wouldn't be required of a member of another class. For example, older applicants must not be asked questions regarding health if younger applicants aren't asked the same questions. The absence of any logical explanation for questions that identify an applicant's membership in a protected class may be viewed as evidence of discrimination. With regard to age, an employer may only ask whether an applicant is between 18 and 65, unless otherwise provided by law. Proof of age may only be requested if age is a business necessity. Preemployment medical inquiries or inquiries as to whether an applicant is handicapped or the severity of the handicap aren't allowed except as provided in the Physical Handicap Outline. Employers may not seek to obtain any genetic information regarding an applicant. Employers may make the inquiries necessary for compliance with the affirmative action requirements of the federal or District of Columbia government when taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination or when taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited employment opportunities for a protected group in accordance with the D.C. Human Rights Act. The processing and retention of applications and the information in the applications must be done equally without regard to a person's membership in a protected class.
